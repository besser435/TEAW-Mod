# TEAW Mod

This is a mod for Minecraft 1.18 and the TEAW Minecraft server. Right now it only adds commemorative coins for players who attend the TEAW events, but additional content may be added soon.

[Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create) is needed to craft a few items. The event coins are not craftable, as those are handed out by the server admins to players who attend the events.

# Contributing
I welcome contributions, as well as they aren't too horrible. I might add guidelines later, but since I'm lazy that probably wont happen.
You can either open an issue or pull request.
